# BotCafe_Chatbot

In this project, I'm given the task of creating a Python chatbot that can help cut the wait time of a normal coffee run by taking customersâ€™ orders in advance for a cafe named **Bot Cafe**. 
I mainly made use of python functions and decision tree to complete this project and further creative questions can be added easily.
